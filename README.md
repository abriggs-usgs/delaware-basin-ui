# Delaware River Basin Project 
The Delaware River Basin Project seeks to visualize various stream sections and water
monitoring locations so that researchers will better understand their model systems.

Technology wise, the Delaware River Basin Project builds off a structure created in two
other projects residing on GitHub.

[makerspace-website-base](https://github.com/usgs-makerspace/makerspace-website-base)

[wbeep-viz](https://github.com/usgs-makerspace/wbeep-viz)

Each of these projects contain a detailed Readme that explains, step by step, how to set up 
projects that are the fundamental basis of this one. Looking at 'makerspace-website-base' first will provide foundational knowledge
that is expanded in a more project specific way in the Readme of the 'wbeep-viz'.
